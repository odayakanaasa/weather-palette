# 🎨 Weather Palette
**We all think about our friends - how they are doing once in a while, don't we?**
Weather Palette is a weather information shown on a beautiful picture of my friends' hometown. I met them at a coding bootcamp - [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/) in Tokyo 2017 and it was such a precious experience. Select their hometown and check out how the weather is like over there is pretty fun. Demo:http://oafish-attention.surge.sh/
